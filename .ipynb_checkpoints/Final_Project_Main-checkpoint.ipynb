    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project consists on the analysis of the Medical Cost Personal Dataset, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance and which includes the personal data of people who have a health insurance in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for choosing this dataset is an interest in investigating the parameters that insurance companies are choosing to calculate their client's insurance price and whether this choice is justified by an increase in medical cost bills. In particular, we are interested in knowing whether insurance companies are charging more to smokers and to people with higher BMIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables of the dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **age**: age of the insurace's primary beneficiary\n",
    "- **sex**: insurace's primary beneficiary gender (female or male)\n",
    "- **bmi**: body mass index, defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and expressed in units of kg/m2.\n",
    "- **children**: number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents\n",
    "- **smoker**: whether the primary beneficiary is a current smoker or not\n",
    "- **region**: the primary beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\n",
    "- **charges**: individual medical costs billed by health insurance\n"
